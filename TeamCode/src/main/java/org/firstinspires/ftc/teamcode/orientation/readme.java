/*

for both files you just need basic "frontLeft", "frontRight", "backLeft", and "backRight" spelled exactly how they are inside the quotes,
motors for drive train.

The Orient file is for autonomous code, have the freshies go and experiment with basic functions going forward, back, left and right,
maybe even turns if I get to it. Have them explore the functions and how to use them, have them create their own path.

Orient tele of course is for teleop. There have a basic drive train set up, but make it modifiable to be able to change from different controls
for example they can change a stick control to a bumper controll.
